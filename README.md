dune-quotes
===========

[`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) plugin to print Dune (film & book) quotes in terminal.

Details
-------

This is my personal version of [Dune-Quotes](git@github.com:BrunoGomesCoelho/dune-quotes.git). The only difference is the addition of more quotes from other sci-fi realted things. Currently there is a list of Dune and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

Installation
------------

1. Clone repo into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrunoGomesCoelho/dune-quotes.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/dune-quotes
```

2. Activate plugin in your `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
plugins=(
	dune-quotes
)
```

3. Source `~/.zshrc` or open new terminal session.

4. The sleeper must awaken.
